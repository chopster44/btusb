## [ FORK ]
i tried to run this on debian 13 to get a MA530 bluetooth dongle working, but it
would not work for me. some of the variables have changed since this was made, 
and the kernel is reported differently on debian to the original user's system.
so check my changes (`btusb.patch`, `update.sh`) if you want to use this.

the rest of the instructions below will work the same.

***

My patch to fix `hci0: Opcode 0x c77 failed: -56` issue from kernel log and
`No default controller available` in bluetoothctl. Stuttering audio in bluetooth
device will also be fixed (in my case) probably because the kernel is using
generic driver as fallback.

## Applying patch

The patch is simply adding the hardware ID and manufacturer of the bluetooth
device to usb device table in `btusb.c`. For alternative way check
[this branch](https://github.com/Cudiph/btusb/tree/patchfile)

1. Update code to current kernel version and Get the ID

```console
$ ./update.sh
$ lsusb | grep tooth
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 13d3:3537 IMC Networks Bluetooth Radio
```

2. stage the changes with `$ git add .` so next diff from git will only show the
   custom patch

3. Edit the source code

```diff
static const struct usb_device_id blacklist_table[] = {
  ...

	/* Additional Realtek 8822BE Bluetooth devices */
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3526), .driver_info = BTUSB_REALTEK },
+	{ USB_DEVICE(0x13d3, 0x3537), .driver_info = BTUSB_REALTEK },
	{ USB_DEVICE(0x0b05, 0x185c), .driver_info = BTUSB_REALTEK },

  ...
}
```

4. Generate the patch with

```sh
git diff > btusb.patch
```

5. Apply patch with

```sh
patch < btusb.patch
```

6. Install module manually

```sh
sudo make install
```

or using dkms (will automatically rebuild when updating kernel)

```sh
sudo make dkms-install
```

## Uninstalling

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

i also found that the realtek firmware is not auto-installed on debian, which
may make this redundant.
